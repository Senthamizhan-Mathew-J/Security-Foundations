Security Foundations

This place holds what I’ve explored by doing basic cybersecurity tasks myself.

This work centers on developing solid skills in Linux, networking, inspecting data packets, along with fundamental scanning across basic network structures.

 What This Project Covers
  1. Linux Basics

File system navigation

File and directory permissions (rwx)

Users and groups

Process monitoring (ps, top)

Basic shell commands and piping

Outcome:
Handling the Linux terminal with comfort means I can navigate commands without issues. Permissions matter because they shape who gets access - this affects the system's overall safety directly.

2. Networking Fundamentals

TCP/IP model

DNS resolution

TCP three-way handshake

HTTP request and response

Common ports and services

Outcome:
Grasping how info flows between client and server across the web.

3. Wireshark Packet Analysis

Capturing live traffic

Identifying DNS packets

Watching the TCP connection set up

Looking at web traffic

Outcome:
Figuring out simple network data comes within reach. Seeing how packets talk at a basic level? That clicks too.

4. Nmap Scanning

Basic port scanning

Service version detection

Identifying open ports

Outcome:
Exposed services can be seen using tools like nmap. Basic network scans often reveal open ports or running services.

Tools used include note taking, question clarification and analysis of provided data.

Linux Virtual Machine

Wireshark

Nmap

Cisco Packet Tracer (for networking practice)

 Purpose of This Repository

Start here to lay out a reliable cybersecurity base prior to diving into more complex areas such as:

Offensive security

Cloud security

SIEM tools

Intrusion detection

Web application security

Starting here, I take my initial clear move toward becoming a cybersecurity specialist.
